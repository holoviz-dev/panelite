    "# Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we delved into [building a simple app](build_app.md). A Panel app like this makes exploration of various visualizations very easy, supporting types such as Matplotlib, Bokeh, Plotly, Altair, DataFrame, and various text and image types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explain the core concepts of Panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "As you gear up to develop your Panel application, you'll encounter a couple of initial decisions to make regarding **approach** and **environment**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Programming Approach:** Will you opt for a Python *function-based* approach or a *class-based* approach?\n",
    "   - The function-based approach is recommended for new and basic users. It utilizes `pn.bind`, as you've already experienced while [building a simple app](build_app.md).\n",
    "   - The class-based approach is recommended for intermediate Panel users who aim to construct larger and more maintainable apps, as well as reusable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "   :::{dropdown} Interested in a class-based approach instead?\n",
    "   :margin: 4\n",
    "   :color: muted\n",
    "   Explore the same ['outlier' app built using a class-based declarative API](../explanation/api/examples/outliers_declarative.md). Study the [Explanation > APIs](../explanation/api/index.md) section for a detailed discussion on each of the API options.\n",
    "   :::\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Development Environment:** Will you develop in a notebook or in an editor environment?\n",
    "   - If you're unsure, starting in a notebook is recommended as you familiarize yourself with Panel. However, you can switch between them at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In a notebook, you can swiftly iterate on individual components of your application because Panel components render inline. To get started in a notebook, simply `import panel` and initialize the extension with `pn.extension()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import panel as pn\n",
    "pn.extension()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By placing a Panel component at the end of a notebook cell, it renders as part of the output. You can then modify the code and re-run the cell to iterate and build the individual units of your final application. This iterative approach offers many benefits, enabling you to work on each component independently without re-running your entire application each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://assets.holoviz.org/panel/gifs/jupyterlab_preview.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "To add Panel components to your app, mark them as `.servable()` and serve the app with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "panel serve app.ipynb --dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already experimented with this while [building a simple app](build_app.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editor\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working in an editor, declare the Panel components you want to display as `.servable()`, then serve the script with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "panel serve app.py --dev --show\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon running that command, Panel launches a server that serves your app, opens a tab in your default browser (`--show`), and updates the application whenever you modify the code (`--dev`).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://assets.holoviz.org/panel/gifs/vscode_autoreload.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "We recommend installing [`watchfiles`](https://watchfiles.helpmanual.io) to get the best user experience when using `--dev` flag.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "Explore [How-to > Prepare to Develop](../how_to/prepare_to_develop.md) for more guidance on each development environment option.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel operates on a powerful framework called [Param](https://param.holoviz.org/), which governs how information flows within your app. When a change occurs, such as the value of a slider or a manual update in your code, events are triggered for your app to respond to. Panel provides various methods for setting up this interactivity. Understanding the basics of Param is crucial to mastering Panel. However, it's not necessary to get started as a new, basic user.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what exactly is Param? It's a framework that enables Python classes to have attributes with defaults, type/value validation, and callbacks when values change. You can liken it to other frameworks like Python dataclasses, [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), and [Traitlets](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactivity is a key concept in both Param and Panel. This means changes in one part of your app can automatically update other parts. Think of it like Excel, where altering one cell can prompt updates in cells that reference it. Param objects operate similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Panel, understanding the distinction between a Parameter's value and the Parameter object itself is important. The value represents the current value at a specific moment, while the object contains information about the Parameter and serves as a reference to its value over time. In many cases, you can utilize a Parameter object, and Panel will handle updating the value reactively as it changes. For instance, consider a widget:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = pn.widgets.TextInput()\n",
    "\n",
    "text.value  # ðŸ‘ˆ The current value of the widget\n",
    "text.param.value  # ðŸ‘ˆ A reference to the \"value\" Parameter, used in Panel to bind to the \"value\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll delve deeper into this later. For now, remember that parameter objects (whether associated with widgets or not) enable you to pass around a reference to a value that automatically updates if the original value changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Display and Rendering\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel aims to seamlessly integrate with all your favorite Python libraries and automatically infer how to render a particular object, whether it's a `DataFrame`, a plotting `Figure`, or any other Python object. This means you can effortlessly place any object you want to render into a layout (such as a `Row` or `Column`), and Panel will automatically determine the appropriate `Pane` type to wrap it. Different `Pane` types know how to render different objects but also provide ways to update the object or even listen to events such as selection of Vega/Altair charts or Plotly plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, it's often advantageous to understand the Pane type. For instance, to wrap your `DataFrame` into a pane, you can call the `panel` function, which will automatically convert it (this is precisely what a layout does internally when given an object to render):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "  'A': [1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "  'B': [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "df_pane = pn.panel(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip}\n",
    ":class: success\n",
    "\n",
    "To inspect the type of an object, simply `print` it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(pn.Row(df))\n",
    "Row\n",
    "    [0] DataFrame(DataFrame)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, an object may have multiple possible representations to choose from. In such cases, you can explicitly construct the desired `Pane` type. For example, here are a few representations of a `DataFrame`:\n",

    "So far, we've learned how to display data. However, to actually incorporate it into your served application, you also need to mark it as `.servable()`. Marking an object as servable adds it to the current template, something we'll delve into later. You can either mark multiple objects as servable, which adds them to the page sequentially, or you can use layouts to arrange objects explicitly.\n",

    "## Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've begun building an application, you'll likely want to enhance its appearance, which is where templates come into play. When you mark an object as `.servable()`, you're inserting it into a template. By default, Panel employs a completely blank template, but selecting another template is straightforward by setting `pn.config.template`. You'll have several options based on different frameworks, including `'bootstrap'`, `'material'`, and `'fast'`.\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've configured a template, you can control where to render your components using the `target` argument of the `.servable()` method. Most templates feature multiple target areas including 'main', 'sidebar', 'header', and 'modal'. For example, you might want to render your widgets into the sidebar and your plots into the main area:\n",
