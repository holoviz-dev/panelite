    "\n",
    "This guide addresses how to configure PyCharm for an efficient Panel development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume you have a basic understanding of [working with Python projects in PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-running-your-first-python-project.html), including running and [debugging](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/debugging-python-code.html) Python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "In the following, we assume you have already created a Python project, installed Panel, and other requirements, and created your Panel file.\n",

    "## Serve from the Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `panel serve` to serve apps from the PyCharm terminal, just as you would with in any other terminal.\n",

    "## Run/Debug Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn how to configure PyCharm in general, check out [the official guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/run-debug-configuration.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable you to run and debug Panel apps in PyCharm, you should create a configuration as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Configure PyCharm for Panel](../../_static/images/pycharm-configure-panel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configuration Name: `panel serve`\n",
    "- Module Name: `panel`\n",
    "- Parameters: `serve $FilePath$`\n",
    "- Working Directory: The path to your *project root*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run\n",
    "\n",
    "With the configuration in place, you can now easily `run` Panel apps via the `panel serve` configuration.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Debug\n",
    "\n",
    "With the configuration in place, you can now easily `debug` Panel apps via the `panel serve` configuration. The picture below shows debugging in action, where a breakpoint is hit when the Button is clicked.\n",

    "\n",
    "To integrate Panel effectively, ensure the installation of `jupyter_bokeh` by executing `pip install jupyter jupyter_bokeh` or `conda install jupyter jupyter_bokeh`. Subsequently, activate the extension using `pn.extension()`.\n",
