    "- [x] Installed the **latest versions** of the VS Code extensions:\n",
    "  - [Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python)\n",
    "  - [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) including [Jupyter Notebook Renderers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers)\n",

    "you need to have [`jupyter_bokeh`](https://github.com/bokeh/jupyter_bokeh) and [`ipykernel`](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel) installed in your virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly recommend you to install into a **new virtual environment** before starting to use Panel with in the Interactive environment. Installing `jupyter_bokeh` and `ipykernel` into an old environment can lead to problems that are hard to reproduce, understand and solve.\n",

    "- closing the interactive window\n",
    "- upgrading VS Code to the latest version\n",

    "- restarting VS code.\n",

    "#### No output\n",

    "## General Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend adding the below to your `settings.json` file on Windows\n",

    "\n",
    "On Windows you will need to add quotes around `$.\n",

    "## Snippets\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up your workflow you can configure [*user defined snippets*](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) like these [example Panel snippets](../../_static/json/vscode-snippets-python.json). When you start typing `import panel` you will get the option to select between the snippets as shown below.\n",
