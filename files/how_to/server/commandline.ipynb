    "Once the app is ready for deployment it can be served using the Bokeh server.  For a detailed breakdown of the design and functionality of Bokeh server, see the [Bokeh documentation](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html). The most important thing to know is that Panel (and Bokeh) provide a CLI command to serve a Python script, app directory, or Jupyter notebook containing a Bokeh or Panel app. To launch a server using the CLI, simply run:\n",
