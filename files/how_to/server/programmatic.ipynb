    "# Launching a server dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLI `panel serve` command described below is usually the best approach for deploying applications. However when working on the REPL or embedding a Panel/Bokeh server in another application it is sometimes useful to dynamically launch a server, either using the `.show` method or using the `pn.serve` function.\n",

    "## Previewing an application\n",
    "\n",
    "Working from the command line will not automatically display rich representations inline as in a notebook, but you can still interact with your Panel components if you start a Bokeh server instance and open a separate browser window using the ``show`` method. The method has the following arguments:\n",

    "title : str | None\n",
