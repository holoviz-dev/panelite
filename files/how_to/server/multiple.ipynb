    "Note that when you serve an object directly all sessions will share the same state, i.e. the parameters of all components will be synced across sessions such that the change in a widget by one user will affect all other users. Therefore you will usually want to wrap your app in a function, ensuring that each user gets a new instance of the application:\n",
