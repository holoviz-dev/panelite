    "# Embedding a Panel Server in FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel generally runs on the Bokeh server which itself runs on Tornado. However, it is also often useful to embed a Panel app in large web application, such as a FastAPI web server. [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is especially useful compared to others like Flask and Django because of it's lightning fast, lightweight framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following FastAPI's [Tutorial - User Guide](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) make sure you first have FastAPI installed using: `conda install -c conda-forge fastapi`. Also make sure Panel is installed `conda install -c conda-forge panel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start adding a bokeh app to our FastAPI server we have to set up some of the basic plumbing. In the `examples/apps/fastApi` folder we will add some basic configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to create a file called `examples/apps/fastApi/main.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `main.py` you'll need to import the following( which should all be already available from the above conda installs):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import panel as pn\n",
    "from bokeh.embed import server_document\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI, Request\n",
    "from fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these will be explained as we add them in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we are going to need to create an instance of FastAPI below your imports in `main.py` and set up the path to your templates like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "templates = Jinja2Templates(directory=\"examples/apps/fastApi/templates\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now need to create our first route via an async function and point it to the path of our server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.get(\"/\")\n",
    "async def bkapp_page(request: Request):\n",
    "    script = server_document('http://127.0.0.1:5000/app')\n",
    "    return templates.TemplateResponse(\"base.html\", {\"request\": request, \"script\": script})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in this code we will also need to create an html  [Jinja2](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/templates/#using-jinja2templates) template. Create a new directory named `examples/apps/fastApi/templates` and create the file `examples/apps/fastApi/templates/base.html` in that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now add the following to `base.html`. This is a minimal version but feel free to add whatever else you need to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Panel in FastAPI: sliders</title>\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        {{ script|safe }}\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Return back to your `examples/apps/fastApi/main.py` file. We will use pn.serve() to start the bokeh server (Which Panel is built on). Configure it to whatever port and address you want, for our example we will use port 5000 and address 127.0.0.1. show=False will make it so the bokeh server is spun up but not shown yet. The allow_websocket_origin will list of hosts that can connect to the websocket, for us this is FastAPI so we will use (127.0.0.1:8000). The `createApp` function call in this example is how we call our panel app. This is not set up yet but will be in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pn.serve({'/app': createApp},\n",
    "        port=5000, allow_websocket_origin=[\"127.0.0.1:8000\"],\n",
    "        address=\"127.0.0.1\", show=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could optionally add BOKEH_ALLOW_WS_ORIGIN=127.0.0.1:8000 as an environment variable instead of setting it here. In conda it is done like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda env config vars set BOKEH_ALLOW_WS_ORIGIN=127.0.0.1:8000`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sliders app\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on a standard FastAPI app template, this app shows how to integrate Panel and FastAPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sliders app is in `examples/apps/fastApi/sliders`. We will cover the following additions/modifications to the Django2 app template:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `sliders/sinewave.py`: a parameterized object (representing your pre-existing code)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `sliders/pn_app.py`: creates an app function from the SineWave class\n",
    "\n",
    "  To start with, in `sliders/sinewave.py` we create a parameterized object to serve as a placeholder for your own, existing code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import param\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However the app itself is defined we need to configure an entry point, which is a function that adds the application to it. In case of the slider app it looks like this in `sliders/pn_app.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import panel as pn\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to return to our `main.py` and import the createApp function. Add the following import near the other imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sliders.pn_app import createApp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your file structure should now be like the following:\n",

It is of course possible to add multiple apps in the same way and then registering them with FastAPI in the way described in the [configuration](#configuration) section above.

    "1. Create a new directory in your and a new file with your panel app (ex. `sinewave.py`).\n",
