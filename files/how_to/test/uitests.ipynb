    "# Test UI rendering\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide addresses how to test the UI with Pytest and Playwright.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is key to developing robust and performant applications. Particularly when you build complex UIs you will want to ensure that it behaves as expected. Unit tests will allow you test that the logic on the backend behaves correctly, but it is also useful to test that the UI is rendered correctly and responds appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "For testing the UI we recommend the framework [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). Panel itself is tested with this framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you get started ensure you have installed the required dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install panel pytest pytest-playwright\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and ensure `playwright` sets up the browsers it will use to display the applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "playwright install\n",
