    "# PY.CAFE Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to deploy a Panel app on [PY.CAFE](https://py.cafe/).\n",
    "\n",
    "PY.CAFE is a platform for creating and sharing data apps online, powered by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/). It offers a free tier for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Log In\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit [PY.CAFE](https://py.cafe/) and either sign in or sign up for an account if you want to save your projects to your personal gallery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Choose the Panel Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the Panel framework from the available options or use the direct link [PY.CAFE/snippet/panel](https://py.cafe/snippet/panel/v1).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Update the `requirements.txt` File\n",
    "\n",
    "Add `panel` and any other necessary dependencies to your `requirements.txt` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "panel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to pin version of panel or other dependencies as PY.CAFE will create a lock file with pinned versions automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Update the `app.py` File\n",
    "\n",
    "Update your `app.py` file with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import panel as pn\n",
    "\n",
    "pn.extension()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def model(n=5):\n",
    "    return \"‚≠ê\" * n\n",
    "\n",
    "slider = pn.widgets.IntSlider(value=5, start=1, end=5)\n",
    "\n",
    "interactive_model = pn.bind(model, n=slider)\n",
    "\n",
    "layout = pn.Column(slider, interactive_model)\n",
    "\n",
    "pn.template.FastListTemplate(\n",
    "    site=\"Panel\", title=\"Example\", main=[layout],\n",
    ").servable()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After updating the file, save it, and the app will reload instantly.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally you can click **PUSH** to persist your app and click **SHARE** to share it with the world.\n",
