    "First, you need to set up your Google cloud account following the [Cloud Run documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/python) or the [App Engine documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/quickstart) depending on whether you would like to deploy your Panel app to Cloud Run or App Engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will need three files:\n",
    "1. app.py: This is the Python file that creates the Panel App.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. requirements.txt: This file lists all the package dependencies of our Panel app. Here is an example for requirements.txt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "panel\n",
    "bokeh\n",
    "hvplot\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. app.yml (for App Engine) or Dockerfile (for Cloud Run)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example for app.yml (if you would like to deploy to App Engine):\n",
    "```\n",
    "runtime: python\n",
    "env: flex\n",
    "entrypoint: panel serve app.py --address 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --allow-websocket-origin=\"*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "runtime_config:\n",
    "  python_version: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example for Dockerfile (if you would like to deploy to Cloud Run):\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Use the official lightweight Python image.\n",
    "# https://hub.docker.com/_/python\n",
    "FROM python:3.10-slim\n",
    "\n",
    "# Allow statements and log messages to immediately appear in the Knative logs\n",
    "ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy local code to the container image.\n",
    "ENV APP_HOME /app\n",
    "WORKDIR $APP_HOME\n",
    "COPY . ./\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install production dependencies.\n",
    "RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the web service on container startup.\n",
    "CMD panel serve app.py --address 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --allow-websocket-origin=\"*\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to deploy a Panel app to App Engine run `gcloud app create` and `gcloud app deploy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deploying with Cloud Run\n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy a Panel app to Cloud Run, run `gcloud run deploy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel apps use a websocket to the running Bokeh server. Websockets are considered by Cloud Run to be long-running HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you deploy a panel app on GCP with Cloud Run, make sure you set up a long request timeout, with CLI parameter `--timeout=...`\n",
    "\n",
    "The default timeout is 5 minutes, which makes the panel app lose its websocket connection after this time, leading to unresponsive UI, because Cloud Run considers the websocket as timed-out.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extend the timeout up to 60 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend the timeout duration, run `gcloud run deploy --timeout 60min`.\n",
    "\n",
