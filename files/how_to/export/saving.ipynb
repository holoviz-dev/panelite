    "# Save App to File\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide addresses how to export an app to a HTML or PNG file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you don't need an actual server or simply want to export a static snapshot of a panel app, you can use the ``save`` method, which allows exporting the app to a standalone HTML or PNG file.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the HTML file generated will depend on loading JavaScript code for BokehJS from the online ``CDN`` repository, to reduce the file size. If you need to work in an air-gapped or no-network environment, you can declare that ``INLINE`` resources should be used instead of ``CDN``:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bokeh.resources import INLINE\n",
    "panel.save('test.html', resources=INLINE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally the save method also allows enabling the `embed` option, which, as explained above, will embed the apps state in the app or save the state to json files which you can ship alongside the exported HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if a 'png' file extension is specified, the exported plot will be rendered as a PNG, which currently requires Selenium and PhantomJS to be installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pane.save('test.png')\n",
    "```\n",
