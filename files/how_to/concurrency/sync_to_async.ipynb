    "\n",
    "This example will show how to make your app responsive by running a sync, cpu bound function asynchronously. We will be using [asyncer](https://asyncer.tiangolo.com) by Tiangolo. You can install the package via `pip install asyncer`.\n",

    "If you run many cpu bound functions you may consider offloading your functions asynchronously to an external compute engine like [Dask](https://www.dask.org/). See our [Dask how-to Guide](../concurrency/dask).\n"
