    "# Add Interactivity with `pn.bind`\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Streamlit and Panel are *reactive* frameworks that respond dynamically to user interactions within your application. However, their operational mechanics differ significantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Streamlit**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The script runs once when a user visits the page.\n",
    "- The script reruns from the *top to bottom* upon any user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Panel**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The script runs once when a user visits the page.\n",
    "- Only *specific, bound functions* are rerun based on user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel's interactivity architecture enables you to develop and maintain larger and more complex apps efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel's `pn.bind` function allows you to *bind* functions to widgets, creating what we refer to as *bound functions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `pn.bind`, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Define your function(s)\n",
    "def my_func(value):\n",
    "    return ...\n",
    "# 2. Define your widgets\n",
    "slider = pn.widgets.IntSlider(...)\n",
    "# 3. Bind your function to the widget(s)\n",
    "my_bound_func = pn.bind(my_func, value=slider)\n",
    "# 4. Layout and display your bound functions and widgets\n",
    "pn.Column(slider, my_bound_func)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've set up your functions and widgets as described, they will automatically update in response to user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Migration Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following strategies for effective migration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transition your core business logic into functions. This includes data loading, transformations, calculations, plot creations, complex computations like galaxy mass estimations, model training, and inference tasks.\n",
    "- Enhance interactivity by using `pn.bind` to associate your functions with widgets.\n",
    "  - For updates that occur multiple times during function execution, consider using generator functions (`yield`).\n",
    "- Use visual feedback to indicate activity, as detailed in the [Show Activity Section](activity).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
