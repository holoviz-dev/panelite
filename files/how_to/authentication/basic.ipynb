    "# Configuring Basic Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple uses cases it may be totally sufficient to enable a basic Auth provider, which simply compares the provided login credentials against a master password or credentials stored in a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up basic authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic authentication can be set up simply by providing the `--basic-auth` commandline argument (or the `PANEL_BASIC_AUTH` environment variable). Here is how to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a basic `app.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import panel as pn\n",
    "\n",
    "pn.extension(template=\"fast\")\n",
    "\n",
    "logout = pn.widgets.Button(name=\"Log out\")\n",
    "logout.js_on_click(code=\"\"\"window.location.href = './logout'\"\"\")\n",
    "pn.Column(f\"Congrats `{pn.state.user}`. You got access!\", logout).servable()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now serve the application\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "panel serve app.py --basic-auth my_password --cookie-secret my_super_safe_cookie_secret\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When loading the application you should now see a very simple login form:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Basic Auth Login Form](../../_static/images/basic_auth.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you enter an invalid password it will look like\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invalid Basic Auth Login Form](../../_static/images/basic_auth_invalid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you enter the valid password (i.e. `my_password`) it will look like\n",
    "\n",
    "![Valid Basic Auth Login Form](../../_static/images/basic_auth_valid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click the *Log out* button you will be sent back to the log in form.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mode the `username` is not authenticated. The `username` is provided as part of the [user info](user_info).\n",
    "\n",
    "## User credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a slightly more complex setup with a number of different users with potentially different access controls you can also provide a path to a file containing user credentials, e.g. let's say we have a file called `credentials.json` containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"user1\": \"my_password\",\n",
    "    \"admin\": \"my_super_safe_password\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now configure the basic authentication with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "panel serve app.py --basic-auth credentials.json --cookie-secret my_super_safe_cookie_secret\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic auth provider will now check the provided credentials against the credentials declared in this file.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Note\n",
    "When serving an application dynamically using `pn.serve` you can also provide a dictionary of usernames and passwords via the `basic_auth` keyword argument.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom templates\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Prerequisites\n",
    "For a more in-depth understanding of custom template take a look at the [how to > Build a Custom Template](../templates/template_custom) guide.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to customize the authentication template you can provide a custom template with the `--basic-login-template` CLI argument. The template needs to submit `username` and `password` to the `/login` endpoint of the Panel server, e.g. the form of the default template looks like this. Check out the default template [here](https://github.com/holoviz/panel/blob/main/panel/_templates/basic_login.html) for inspiration.\n"
