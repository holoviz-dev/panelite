    "# OAuth Providers\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel supports a number of OAuth providers out-of-the-box. Follow the guide for setting up an OAuth application specific to your provider and then refer to the [Configuring OAuth guide](configuration) to add OAuth to your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Azure Active Directory**\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up OAuth2.0 authentication for Azure Active directory follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-protect-backend-with-aad). In addition to the `oauth_key` and `oauth_secret` ensure that you also supply the tenant ID using `oauth_extra_params`, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "panel serve oauth_test.py --oauth-extra-params=\"{'tenant': '...'}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "PANEL_OAUTH_EXTRA_PARAMS=\"{'tenant': '...'}\" panel serve oauth_example.py ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Bitbucket**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitbucket provides instructions about setting [setting up an OAuth consumer](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud/). Follow these and then supply the `oauth_key` and `oauth_secret` to Panel as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **GitHub**\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub provides detailed instructions on [creating an OAuth app](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/). Follow these and then supply the `oauth_key` and `oauth_secret` to Panel as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **GitLab**\n",
    "\n",
    "GitLab provides a detailed guide on [configuring an OAuth](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/oauth2.html) application. In addition to the `oauth_key` and `oauth_secret` you will also have to supply a custom url using the `oauth_extra_params` if you have a custom GitLab instance (the default `oauth_extra_params={'url': 'gitlab.com'}`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Google**\n",
    "\n",
    "Google provides a guide about [configuring a OAuth application](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app). By default nothing except the `oauth_key` and `oauth_secret` are required but to access Google services you may also want to override the default `scope` via the `oauth_extra_params`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Okta**\n",
    "\n",
    "Okta provides a guide about [configuring OAuth2](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/). You must provide an `oauth_key` and `oauth_secret` but in most other ordinary setups you will also have to provide a `url` via the `oauth_extra_params` and if you have set up a custom authentication server (i.e. not 'default') with Okta you must also provide 'server', the `oauth_extra_params` should then look something like this: `{'server': 'custom', 'url': 'dev-***.okta.com'}`\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Auth0**\n",
    "\n",
    "Auth0 provides detailed documentation about [configuring a OAuth application](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/application-settings). In addition to the `oauth_key` and `oauth_secret` you must also provide a `subdomain` via the `oauth_extra_params`, i.e. you must provide something like: `for your Auth0 API and provide that along with the subdomain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Generic**/**Password**/**Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `'generic'`, `'password'` and `'code'` OAuth providers allows you to provide custom authentication endpoints using the `--oauth-extra-param` or using environment variables. Specifically you must provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `AUTHORIZE_URL`: The authorization endpoint of the authentication server, may also be provided using the `PANEL_OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL` environment variable.\n",
    "- `TOKEN_URL`: The token endpoint of the authentication server, may also be provided using the `PANEL_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL` environment variable.\n",
    "- `USER_URL`: The user information endpoint of the authentication server, may also be provided using the `PANEL_OAUTH_USER_URL` environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between these three providers is the authentication flow they perform. The `generic` provider uses the standard authentication flow, which requests authorization using the client secret, while the `password` based workflow lets the user log in via a form served on the server (only recommended for testing and development), and the `code` uses a code challenge based auth flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "The Panel OAuth providers are pluggable, in other words downstream libraries may define their own Tornado `RequestHandler` to be used with Panel. To register such a component the `setup.py` of the downstream package should register an entry_point that Panel can discover. To read more about entry points see the [Python documentation](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/). A custom OAuth request handler in your library may be registered as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "entry_points={\n",
    "    'panel.auth': [\n",
    "        \"custom = my_library.auth:MyCustomOAuthRequestHandler\"\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n"
