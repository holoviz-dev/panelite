    "# Defer Long Running Tasks to Improve the User Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide addresses how to defer and orchestrate long running background tasks with `pn.state.onload`. You can use this to improve the user experience of your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user opens your app, the app is *loaded* as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "- the app file is executed\n",
    "- the app template is sent to the user and rendered\n",
    "- a web socket connection is opened to enable fast, bi-directional communication as your interact with the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus any long running code executed before the app is loaded will increase the the waiting time before your users see your apps template. **If the waiting time is more than 2-5 seconds your users might get confused and even leave the application behind**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an app that takes +5 seconds to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "import panel as pn\n",
    "\n",
    "pn.extension(template=\"bootstrap\")\n",
    "\n",
    "layout = pn.pane.Markdown()\n",
    "\n",
    "def some_long_running_task():\n",
    "    time.sleep(5) # Some long running task\n",
    "    layout.object = \"# Wow. That took some time. Are you still here?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "some_long_running_task()\n",
    "\n",
    "layout.servable()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![panel-longrunning-task-example](https://assets.holoviz.org/panel/gifs/long_load.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets learn how to defer long running tasks to after the application has loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defer a Task\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "import panel as pn\n",
    "\n",
    "pn.extension(template=\"bootstrap\")\n",
    "\n",
    "layout = pn.pane.Markdown(\"# Loading...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def some_long_running_task():\n",
    "    time.sleep(5) # Some long running task\n",
    "    layout.object = \"# Done\"\n",
    "\n",
    "pn.state.onload(some_long_running_task)\n",
    "\n",
    "layout.servable()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![panel-onload-example](https://assets.holoviz.org/panel/gifs/onload_callback.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `pn.state.onload` accepts both *sync* and *async* functions and also accepts a `threaded` argument, which, when combined with [enabling `config.nthreads`](../concurrency/threading) will run the callbacks concurrently on separate threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example could also be implemented using a *bound and displayed function*. We recommend using that method together with `defer_load` when possible. See the [Defer Bound and Displayed Functions Guide](defer_load).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defer and Orchestrate Dependent Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you have multiple tasks that depend on each other and you need to *orchestrate* them. To handle those scenarios you use `pn.state.onload` to defer background tasks and `pn.bind` to trigger *bound and displayed* functions when the the background tasks have finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take an example where we\n",
    "\n",
    "- load a shared dataset.\n",
    "- display the dataset in a Table\n",
    "- transform the dataset and display it as a plot\n",
