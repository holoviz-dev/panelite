    "# Build a Widget in Python\n",

    "\n",
    "We will leverage the `PyComponent` class to construct this custom widget. The `PyComponent` allows us to combine multiple Panel components into a more complex and functional widget. The resulting class will combine a `MultiSelect` widget with a dynamic number of `FloatInput` widgets.\n",

    "This is a lot to take in so let us break it down into a few pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "The `FeatureInput` class inherits from `pn.custom.PyComponent` and `pn.widgets.WidgetBase`. This multiple inheritance structure allows us to create custom components that behave one of the three core component types that Panel defines `Widget`, `Pane` and `Panel` (i.e. a layout). You should always inherit from the component type base class first, i.e. `WidgetBase` in this case and the component implementation class second, i.e. `PyComponent` in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "It defines the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `value`: A dictionary that stores the selected features and their corresponding values.\n",
    "- `features`: A dictionary of available features and their default values.\n",
    "- `selected_features`: The list of features that have been selected.\n",
    "- `_selected_widgets`: A \"private\" column layout that contains the widgets for editing the selected features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State handling\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most important methods in configuring state are the constructor (`__init__`) and the (`__panel__`) method which will be invoked to create the component lazily at render time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `__init__` method, we initialize the widget parameters and create a `MultiChoice` widget for selecting features. We also set up a column to hold the selected feature widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `__panel__`\n",
    "\n",
    "`PyComponent` classes must define a `__panel__` method which tells Panel how the component should be rendered. Here we return a layout of the `MultiSelect` and a column containing the selected features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syncing state\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `@param.depends` decorators to define methods that react to changes in the `features` and `selected_features` parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `_reset_selected_features`: Ensures that only available features are selected.\n",
    "- `_handle_selected_features_change`: Updates the widgets and the `value` parameter when the selected features change.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Widget Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "The `_update_value` method updates the `value` parameter based on the current values of the feature widgets. The `_update_selected_widgets` method creates and updates the widgets for the selected features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create an application to demonstrate our custom `FeatureInput` widget in action. We will define a set of features related to a wind turbine and use our widget to select and set their values:\n",
