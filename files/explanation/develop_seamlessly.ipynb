    "\n",
    "- you can actually develop apps that are meant to live only in a notebook, that you will share as a file with your colleagues and friends. Panel allows you to make your notebooks more user friendly, like [IPywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) does.\n",
    "- you can serve a notebook with `panel serve file.ipynb`, Panel will parse your notebook to collect all of its code and run it as if it were a Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks aren't the only flavor of notebooks available, Panel also supports Visual Studio Code and Google Colab notebooks, and probably works fine on other platforms. For Visual Studio Code notebooks, you will need to install the `jupyter_bokeh` package in your environment.\n",

Panel catches all the content sent to *stdout* and *stderr* when callbacks are executed and renders it above the displayed object. The default mode of this functionality is to accumulate content, you can modify this by setting `pn.config.console_output` to `'replace'` for instance to only see the last message caught. Move the slider in the little app below to see the stream of printed messages being displayed in the notebook.\n",
